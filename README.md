Please don't use my layout. I realise this blog rests entirely on the shoulder of 
open source projects, however I put the layout together for my own blog only. It 
isn't open source. I've put hundreds of hours over the years into releasing free 
and open source software, so please think twice before labelling me some kind of 
leech for wanting to keep this one thing for my blog only.

Thanks for understanding.
