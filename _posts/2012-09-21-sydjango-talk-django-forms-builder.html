<p>Last night I gave a talk at the third <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SyDjango/">SyDjango</a> meetup where I presented my <a href="https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-forms-builder">django-forms-builder</a> project. Below are the slides from the talk which went really well, spurring about a dozen questions at the end. Thanks to all the fellow Sydney Djangonauts who came along and made it a great night.</p>
