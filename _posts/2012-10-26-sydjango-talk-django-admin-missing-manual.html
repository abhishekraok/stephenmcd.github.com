<p>
Last night I gave my second <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SyDjango/">
SyDjango</a> talk, "Django Admin, The Missing Manual". There were
quite a few new faces this month, as well as a good mix of regular
Djangonauts from previous months.
</p>

<p>
In this talk I covered the <a
href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/">Django
Admin</a>, some reasons people might not use it, why you should use it
anyway, and how to address some of those possible issues. I walked
through a basic project for a blog with a spartan Django Admin interface,
and the steps involved in turning it into a much more featureful and
attractive experience for the end user.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again to all the fellow Sydney Djangonauts who came along
and made it a great night. You can find source code for this talk
on both <a href="https://github.com/stephenmcd/sydjango-damm">GitHub</a>
 and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/stephenmcd/sydjango-damm">Bitbucket.</p>
