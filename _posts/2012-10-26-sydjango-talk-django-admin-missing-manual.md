Last night I gave my second [SyDjango](http://www.meetup.com/SyDjango/) talk, *Django Admin, The Missing Manual*. There were
quite a few new faces this month, as well as a good mix of regular
Djangonauts from previous months.

In this talk I covered the [Django Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/), some reasons people might not use it, why you should use it
anyway, and how to address some of those possible issues. I walked
through a basic project for a blog with a spartan Django Admin interface,
and the steps involved in turning it into a much more full-featured and
attractive experience for the end user.

Thanks again to all the fellow Sydney Djangonauts who came along
and made it a great night. You can find source code for this talk
on both [GitHub](https://github.com/stephenmcd/sydjango-damm) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/stephenmcd/sydjango-damm).
