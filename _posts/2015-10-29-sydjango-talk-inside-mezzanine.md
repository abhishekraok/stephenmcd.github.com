For this month's [SyDjango](http://www.meetup.com/SyDjango/), I presented a talk on the core features of Mezzanine and how they're implemented using Django. The aim was to demonstrate the simplicity of Mezzanine, and show the audience how they could build their own CMS using Django.

This was the first time I've given a talk that explored the technical side of Mezzanine, so this will hopefully be a really useful resource for the community. Thanks to [Matt Stevenson](https://twitter.com/mattoc) for inviting me and hosting the event!
