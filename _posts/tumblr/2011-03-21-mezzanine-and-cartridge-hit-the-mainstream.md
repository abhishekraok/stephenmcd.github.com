[Mezzanine and Cartridge Hit the Mainstream](http://www.cio.com.au/article/380
246/melbourne_hacker_releases_open_source_django_apps/)

This week I had the fantastic opportunity to be interviewed by [Rodney
Gedda](http://www.gedda.info/) from [IDG](http://idg.com/) for their
[TechWorld](http://www.techworld.com.au/) and [CIO](http://www.cio.com.au/)
magazines. The interview focused on my open source work with the
[Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/) and
[Cartridge](http://cartridge.jupo.org/) projects.

These projects have been gaining traction at an incredible pace, with a solid
community forming around them over the last year. All of this has happened in
spite of having no formal promotion outside of the community itself, which
makes this type of exposure all the more exciting.

It's also no secret that I think [the Australian web development market is
many years behind the United States](http://blog.jupo.org/2010/09/28/on-
modern-web-development/), so it's a great step forward to see modern
technology getting covered by the mainstream local tech media.
